can i be a water,"polo referee

There is no one definitive answer to this question. Each water polo governing body has their own specific requirements for referees, so it is best to contact them directly to inquire about becoming a referee. Generally speaking, however, most organizations require that referees be at least 18 years old and have experience playing or coaching water polo. Some may also require that referees complete a training course and pass a written exam.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1655648340915-019ee5a3fb2a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=Mnw0MTY0MDh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxjYW4lMjBpJTIwYmUlMjBhJTIwd2F0ZXJ8ZW58MHwwfHx8MTY3ODI2MjI2Mg&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080
